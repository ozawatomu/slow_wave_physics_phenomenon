# Slow wave physics phenomenon

<img src="demo_gif.gif" width="300" alt="Demo">

This is a demonstration of a phsics phenomenon involving waves on a ball chain. Suppose we have a ball chain (or a rope) that is simply hanging in the air. If we hit the top of the chain, we will see a wave propagating down it at a certain velocity. Now if we do the same thing but this time, we pull the chain upwards at the same velocity. Then the wave that is going down the chain will appear as if it is frozen in space. This is what we see above. It is a ball chain loop on a brushless motor that is spinning such that one side of the chain is moving upwards at a velocity similar to the velocity of the wave that propagates down it. The brushless motor is powered by a lithium Polymer battery and controlled using an ESC and an Arduino.
